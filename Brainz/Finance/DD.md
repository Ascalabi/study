# DD
Due diligence is an investigation or review performed to confirm facts or details. Examination of financial records...

Is the basic of Investing and [[Trading]].

Key features of DD are:  
- Overview  
- Identifying and Predicting catalysts (an event that propels the price dramatically up or down)  
- Identifying and predicting risk (risk is usually assessed by considering historical behaviors and outcomes)  
- standard deviation provides a measure of the volatility of asset prices in comparison to their historical averages in a given time frame  

## [[Fundamental analysis]]
**Fundamental analysis** tells you what to buy (could be splitted with Quantitative analysis but wheres the point):  
  
### Qualitative analysis:  
- technology disruption  
- economic moat  
- management  
- you can gain insight that not all traders can see  
  
### Quantitative analysis:  
- assets  
- liabilities  
- revenue, earnings, cash flow..  
- ratios (P/E, PB, P/CF. and etc.)  
  
Metrics to look at:  
-earnings and net income  


## [[Technical analysis]]
Technical analysis tells you when to buy:  
- identifying trading opportunities in price trends and patterns seen on charts  
  
**Support and Resistance Basics**:  
- support occurs where a downtrend is expected to pause due to a concentration of demand  
- resistance occurs where an uptrend is expected to pause temporarily, due to a concentration of supply  
- can be identified using trend-lines and moving averages  
  
**Pullback**:  
- buying opportunities after a large uptrend  
- happens when traders take profits from the uptrend  
- there has to be fundamental signals that the stock will resume its uptrend  
- the difference between a reversal and a pullback is the difference in the fundamental signal... sooo negative for reversal and positive for pullback
