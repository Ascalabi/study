# Technical analysis
The Astrology of [[Trading]].

Technical indicators serve three broad functions: to alert, to confirm and to predict. The signal should be taken in context with other technical analysis tools
	
### Volume:
- used to measure the relative significance of a market move (breakouts...)

### MACD (Moving Avarege Convergence Divergence)
- subtracting the 26 EMA from 12 EMA period (EMA gives more weight to newer prices) and then compering the current MACD and the 9 length signal (EMA of the last 9 MACD)
- when the 12 EMA crosses the 26 a change of momentum is expected, doesn't tell the length of the momentum 
- not a trigger, just showing possible opportunities
	
### BOLL (Bollinger Band)
- a simple moving average (middle band) and an upper and lower band (standard deviations)
- the more prices move to the upper hand the more overbought the market, and the more closer the prices move to the lower band the more oversold...
- **the squeeze**: central concept, when the bands come close together, constricting the moving average, period of low volatility, potential sign of future increased volatility. The opposite applies too...
- yet again not a standalone metric..
	
### RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- a momentum indicator for evaluating asset value
- 70 or above: overvalued
- 30 or below: undervalued
	
### VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price)
- security average price based both on volume and price
- used by large institutions 
- used as a trend confirmation tool with 200 MA
- can work as support or resistance little bit above or below
