# Decentralized Finance 
Is a system that offers some financial products available on a decentralized [[Blockchain]] network. We don't need to rely on a *trust system*, with a middleman like Banks and Brokerage. 

DeFi make it possible for buyers, sellers, landers and borrowers to interact [[Peer to Peer]] or with a strictly software-based middleman.

[[Smart Contract]] automate agreement terms between buyers and sellers or lenders and borrowers make these financial products possible.

DeFi is still an incipient industry whose infrastructure is still being built out. Regulations and oversight of DeFi are minimal or absent.
