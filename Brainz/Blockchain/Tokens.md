# Tokens
A token on Ethereum is basically just a smart contract that follows some common rules - namely it implements a standard set of functions (**ERC20** example) that all other token contracts share, such as **transfer** and **balanceOF** it usually has a mapping balances for each address.


**ERC20** tokens are really cool for tokens that act like currencies.

**ERC721** are fit for crytpo-collectibles. Are not interchangable since are assumed to be unique, and are not divisible.
