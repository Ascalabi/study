# Block-chain
A block-chain is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. They maintain a secure and decentralized record of transactions.

So [[Bitcoin]] is basically just a ledger. A history of transactions.

It guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party.

A block-chain collects information together, in groups knows as **blocks**. Which are then linked together via cryptography

## Transparency
Because of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin's block-chain, all transactions can be transparently viewed by either having a personal node or by using a [[Block Explorer]]
We can see transactions on a block-chain with [[Block Explorer]] 

Every transaction that happens on-chain pays a [[Gas]] fee to node operators

**Consensus:** is the mechanism used to agree on the state of a block-chain ([[Proof Of Work]], [[Proof Of Stake]])
