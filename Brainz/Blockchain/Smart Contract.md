# Smart Contract
A **smart contract** is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Performance of credible transactions without third parties. These transactions are **trackable** and **irreversible**.

**The code is law**
A smart contract deployed to Ethereum, it's **immutable**, so it can never be modified or updated.


Just becasue a DApp is on Ethereum does not automatically mean it's decentralized - you have to actually read the full source code (Backdoors)

## Security

### Preventing Underflow and Overflow
Blah blah u know what that is.

To prevent it we can use **SafeMath**, a OpenZeppelin library that prevents these issues by default.
